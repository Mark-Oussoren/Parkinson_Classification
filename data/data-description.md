Here we include three versions of the data: raw, processed and external/third party if possible.

**Raw**: Data gathered from Kaggle pulled directly from NASA's data repo

**Processed**: Final data for modeling - cleaning, transformations, and the like done

**External**: If possible, this will be examined down the line from a third party to compare the data's integrity against an outside source
